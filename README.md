# Monty-Hall-Playground

Explore the Monty Hall problem with an explanation and code simulations.

This is a Jupyter Notebook in which the Monty Hall problem and it's solution are explained. The discussion is followed by two programs written in Python:
* One program allows you to play the Monty Hall game.
* The other program allows you to run the Monty Hall game many times. This allows the user to make statistical inferences and reinforces the preceeding discussion.

For those unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, press Shift+Enter to execute the programs.

Enjoy
